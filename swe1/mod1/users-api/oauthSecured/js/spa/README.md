# Sample Single Page App (SPA) 
This is based on https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/spa/vanillajs/01-login?download=true and illustrates how to authenticate a user using Auth0's Universal Login Page and then call an API secured by OAuth.
 
### Specifying Auth0 Credentials

To specify the application client ID and domain, make a copy of `auth_config.json.example` and rename it to `auth_config.json`. Then open it in a text editor and supply the values for your application:

### Installation

```bash
$ npm install
```

This will install all of the necessary packages in order for the app to run.

### Running the Application

1. Launch the UsersAPI node application on port 3000 (or the Java SpringBoot app which runs on port 8080 - note if you use this you need to edit the spa code to connect to port 8080)
2. Start this SPA by running:

```bash
$ npm run dev
```
