# Instructions

1. npm install -> installs dependencies
2. npm start -> runs index.js
3. Look in server dir

This will pickup the openapi.yaml file and will generate
the API based on the definitions therein.

## Notes

Sometimes the build doesn't go too smoothly and the endpoints aren't referenced in
the routes file. If this happens, simply remove the new directory and rebuild.
