# Introduction

Hey coaches! Here you will find the starter and solution for `Mod1/Building the UI with a framework`. The solution uses the Vue CDN rather than the Vue CLI. Why? We thought it would be the easiest way to level up apprentices assuming they've not worked with a framework before. The chances are they've worked with HTML + CSS, so this represents a more gentle learning curve. The downside is we end up with a rather bloated `main.js` file.

That being said, if you know the CLI well or you know React well (or other framework), feel free to to use that instead.

# Usage
