# Introduction

Hey coaches! Here you will find the starter and solution for `Mod1/Building the UI with a framework`.

There are two solutions; the one we use on the session notes is the Vue CDN version than the Vue CLI. Why? We thought it would be the easiest way to level up apprentices assuming they've not worked with a framework before. The chances are they've worked with HTML + CSS, so this represents a more gentle learning curve. The downside is we end up with a rather bloated `main.js` file.

That being said, if you know the CLI well or you know React well (or other framework), feel free to to use the CLI solution instead.

# CDN Usage

To run the site, install Live Server VSCode extension and simply right-click the `index.html` file and click 'Open with Live Server'.

# CLI Usage

- Run `npm isntall` in the `src` dir
- Run `npm run serve` to start the server
